# MergeSort Implementations

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

In this repo I tried my best to implement the MergeSort in various ways: 
  - [sequentailly](https://github.com/hakunamatata97k/MergeSort_Implementations/blob/master/MergeSort_Imp/src/PP/MergeSort/SeqMergeSorter.java) 
  - via Threads (parallel):
    - [optimized Implementation](https://github.com/hakunamatata97k/MergeSort_Implementations/blob/master/MergeSort_Imp/src/PP/MergeSort/ParallelMergeSorter.java)
    - [Naive Implementation](https://github.com/hakunamatata97k/MergeSort_Implementations/blob/master/MergeSort_Imp/src/PP/MergeSort/P2Merger.java)
  - via [WorkStealingThreadPool](https://github.com/hakunamatata97k/MergeSort_Implementations/blob/master/MergeSort_Imp/src/PP/MergeSort/ExecutorMergeSorter.java)
  - via [ForkJoin](https://github.com/hakunamatata97k/MergeSort_Implementations/blob/master/MergeSort_Imp/src/PP/MergeSort/ForkMergeSorter.java)



### Papers I've read: 

A) In order to **maximize the understanding** of mergesort and it's implementations i've read your pdfs and the following papers from open-scources: 

* Knowing and understanding the differance between [Executor], [Executors] and [ExecutorService].
* Reading the **complete** javaDoc of the following: 
    - [ThreadPoolExecutor], [Fork/Join], [RecursiveAction].

* Tried my best to understand the concept of [Amdahl's law].

* Parallel Programming from Zuric [lst.ethz.ch].
* Distributed Algorithms and Optimization (stanford) (partially read) [from Drawbacks of Divide and Conquer].
* [Performance analysis of multithreaded sorting algorithms by Kevin Jouper, Henrik Nordin] (amazing/read just the mergesort parts till now.)

B) In order to optimize the code I did read the following: 
* [Writing Testable Code](https://medium.com/feedzaitech/writing-testable-code-b3201d4538eb).

* chosing the rigt method to generate random data thus its being used in all test cases: 
   - [ `Math.random() versus Random.nextInt(int)` ].
   - [Random Number Generation] (Oracle fourm).
   - [Random Number Generator in Java]. chosing the `ThreadLocalRandom` or `SecureRandom` is a bit overkill for our program.
   - having very little understanding of the [Diehard tests].
* premature optimization `>>>1` vs `/`
  - [wikipedia premature optimization]
  - [Is shifting bits faster than multiplying and dividing in Java?]
  - [Should I bit-shift to divide by 2 in Java?]



### Problems encountered me through the Coding per exercise: 

##### Exercise 2: (**Contains unreviewed Issue**)
* I could NOT understand the logic behind terminating the threads via a boolean flag and `synchronized` method!.
* understanding the [Amdahl's law].

##### Exercise 3: 
* the trouble i went throught could be observed in this [StackOverFlow] Question _(asked and answered by me)_.
* Choosing the right Threadpool that will alow the program to work freely without having any memory issues when sorting big data such like `1000.000` . 
    * `newCachedThreadPool` worked till some amount of data i think `70000`then melt down happend.
    * `newFixedThreadPool` failed miserably thus the program would be in hold whenever the threads are busy.
    * `newWorkStealingPool`worked like a charm due to the fact that the workStealing according to the javaDoc:
         >"creates a work-stealing thread pool using all available processors as its target parallelism level." 
    
* managing the  Sorting without wasting objects by making the `sort(LinkedList<T> data) static.

##### Exercise 4: 
* was in general not hard to implement and as in the pervious exercise i had  to make the `sort(LinkedList<T> data) method static.

### Todo for me!

  - Check with prof if he accept the Second approach. (threads dont need temination flag program works fine without it.)
  - Doing the paper work the fifth exercise.
